IEEE 802.15.4e wireless sensors use frequency hopping as it is proven clearly that it improves reliability even in an interference-free scenario. There are 16 channels used by the IEEE 802.15.4 PHY layer. A suggested solution for Wifi interference is use of clear channels however this solution is an over-dimensioning as the other channels can be used with the limited number of transmissions. Multiple networks with less users can run at the same area, to increase the number of maximum retransmissions by decreasing the cycle time this creates an optimization problem for frequency allocation. System parameters such as number of maximum retransmissions and channels allocated for a network, can be used to achieve the required reliability in the deadline of the application.
